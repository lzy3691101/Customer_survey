I explain in detail my issue had been requesting a call from claims because I want them to explain denial of my claim again I was promised a call back within the next business date and it didn’t happen.  My claim was sent Aug of last year, re sent in November until my daughter help me to send it by app in Jan and I was told that it was denied coz I didn’t sent it within 90days?? I reply from that denial and it’s been 3 weeks I have not been replied or called until I made a personal call and still no reply???  I’ve been waiting for call back and explanation on why it’s been denied when it was Petplan that failed to reply on my claims and follow up even on a simple call back. \n",

The phone lines are continually busy & even if I get through & am put on hold I had to call back 3 times after an  hour long wait the first 2 calls with no agent ever answering the call. The third time I waited over half an hour to speak to someone that eventually helped me but was very slow & unhelpful. I believe the phone system problem should be addressed as online is great but some questions need a human answer . It is important to offer those services as well. Thank you for listening :) \n",

I can only imagine what it’s like to deal with this company if I ever had to file a claim. It is my plan to not renew with Petplan. I spent hours on hold dealing with 1 issue, was over billed, and had to call back constantly to get answers when I was expecting to be called by this company. Bad business. Do better \n",
