0,2/4/2021 19:28,julian8000,2,I have never left a review of an app before but this new app is extremely frustrating and wastes an extraordinary amount of time for simple tasks like updating billing information or home address.

The new app and website are AWFUL.  I just filed first claim online, no confirmation, no claim number and doesn’t show in my history and the easy press to call customer service is no longer an option.  In case it might have been isolated incident, I perused the other reviews to find sadly it is not.  As someone who sells software, I am dumbfounded that this could get through QA or that ANYONE viewed this as a better UI.  We are adults and don’t need a cartoon to walk us through each step to file a claim.  And to top it off, as Leo takes you through each step, edit/back options are nonexistent.  In my case, as I was nearing the end the question ‘do you have additional invoices popped up’.  My keyboard is super sensitive and I inadvertently clicked yes.  There was no way to change that reply so I was forced to cancel the entire claim only to redo the entire process again with Leo.  The last app was so far superior to this one even though I encountered glitches on the page opened after submission...that small hassle would be welcomed compared to this app and website.

Apparently, PetPlan has been sold to a new owner who doesn't give a damn about customer service.  I used to recommend Pet Plan to everyone. Now I have to think about this.  You've been great and helpful to my household of babies in the past. Now, I can see where this is heading.  You will be like all the others pet insurance providers.
