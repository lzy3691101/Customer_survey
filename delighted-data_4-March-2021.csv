I’ve talked to several people, emailed Adam who swore he’d take care it and still nothing. I haven’t heard from him in over a month and when I reached out to follow up, crickets! 
Not to mention this is the most expensive dog insurance on the market. The price goes up every year by a lot without letting you know. I also learned that depending on what breed you have it will change your monthly payment and how much it goes up. Not sure how you can base insurance payments on what breed you have. This is definitely a company that has gone down hill in the 6 plus years I’ve been with this company. I recommend shopping around!

It took numerous phone calls and almost 2 weeks to receive my refund.
And then a few days later, I was billed again. Same thing.
Same issue, same supervisor, same rudeness from the supervisor.......it was a glitch that happened TWICE?????
I've been a Petplan customer for years but I will NOT renew and 
the next pet will be covered by a different pet insurance plan.

164315075,Chanda,ckzmoon@gmail.com,1,"I tried to call in on Friday, to discuss my 8 cats and payment on the quarterly plans I have for them.  I needed to move to monthly.  But I was told that now, PetPlan customer service is only available at certain hours and that the staff is overwhelmed. Everything goes to an answering service and now it's too late to make any changes because the payments have triggered, causing me financial hardship.  Apparently, PetPlan has been sold to a new owner who doesn't give a damn about customer service.  I used to recommend Pet Plan to everyone. Now I have to think about this.  You've been great and helpful to my household of babies in the past. Now, I can see where this is heading.  You will be like all the others pet insurance providers.  I have to rethink this financial investment which with 8 pets is becoming a very difficult financial situation during the pandemic when I am looking for F/T work.  I didn't need this from one of the few companies I trusted. But I guess that's the new way of the world.  The staff is still very pleasant--although I haven't talked to anyone except the answering service so far.  I got a call from PetPlan and answered it on Saturday, but after leaving the line open a few seconds, the person on the other end hung up.  So generally, worried, frustrated and not hopeful about the future of a company I used to really trust. ",2/28/2021 11:24,,,3,,3,Other (Customer service),"I think I've said it all. I don't use the new app because I don't have to contact PetPlan all that often, I do it with email and I usually have a question that so-called AI Avatars can't answer.  I also have a very small smart phone and don't want to add more apps!

2.  Changed my reinbursement choice to debit card at least 6 times and it jumps back to check every time.
3.  I have to ask the person answering the phone if they work for petplan now before I talk to them as some of the representatives are called customer service and they don’t know anything. 
4.  If you do happen to get a petplan representative,  they aren’t much better.  They just say they will relay the concerns to the tech department so they don’t actually help you personally.
5.  I waited on hold for 20 minutes just to have someone tell me the office is closed. Why not have a recording. 
6.  Before Someone would always answer the phone immediately- now always on hold.

The rollout was a disaster and needed weeks of testing before prematurely opening it up to customers. Even now you can’t search on claims by let any more. You can’t do many of the things you used to do. Also, I was charged in duplicate for my yearly premium, plus an inappropriate “service fee” which I did nog owe because I pay annually. When I was finally refunded, you inappropriately kept the service fee. I could go on. Everything about the “upgrade” is terrible. The only mitigating factor is that the human beings who still work there are still very good.",janetsomers21@gmail.com,US,,Mobile Safari,Mobile,"Janet, you contacted Petplan recently","We trust your feedback, Janet",iOS,Email,,,108,Somers,,20,5109902152,,PUR3000577-12,1159628,,128,Janet
