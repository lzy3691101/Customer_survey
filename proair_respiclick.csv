13,2021-03-11,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,I was switch from my pro air to the albuteral respiclick.  I will tell you now I think it is one of the worst  I have ever used.

315,2020-11-22,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,"My insurance changed recently due to a new job. I was taking ProAir HFA which worked very well giving me immediate relief. My new insurance does not cover it. I now have coverage for ProAir RespiClick from which I have gotten zero relief. I mean absolutely no relief, it’s completely ineffective. 
The process to inhale the medication is ludicrous. Breathe deeply (when you can barely breathe at all) and the hold your breath for 10 seconds! I thought I was going to pass out. 
Terrible, terrible! Shame on Teva and the FDA for selling this rubbish.",1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"For Asthma, Maintenance:","Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",1.0
319,2020-11-20,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,"I have never had a problem with these inhalers, I prefer them to an inhaler you shake. I think a lot of the issues people are having is if they are unable to breath in strong enough to inhale the powder. The only issue I have is one of my inhalers went through the wash and I cannot figure out how to get a replacement because my dr won’t give me a new prescription. I have found that these last longer than my normal inhalers as well,",1.0,Taken for 2 to 5 years,"For Asthma, acute:","Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",8.0
439,2020-09-06,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,This new inhaler ProAir RespiClick doesn't  do anything. No powder or spray  comes out. The counter works good but there is noooooo relief. $35 dollars - 3 hours I worked for nothing.,1.0,,"For Asthma, acute:","Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",
602,2020-05-22,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,This new inhaler is terrible. Just ask the doctor for my old inhaler back. Even worse.

606,2020-05-19,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,I'm allergic to the propellant in the CFC free Ventolin. I have to use a powder. I first used the GSK rotahaler with no problems. The powder is in a capsule that spun in the rotahaler as you breathe in. You knew if it worked or not. Breathing in the powder is no different to the puffer. It still has to get to your lungs. I saw a demonstration video of the Respiclick. I definitely DON'T want to use it.  The fact you have to open the mouth piece each time to take a puff would be incredibly dangerous in an attack when you're trying to breathe and also trying to open/click the thing. Non-asthmatics designed it as asthmatics know better. I use an Easyhaler. You have to press to release the medication but once again you have no idea if the medicine came out as you can't always feel it when you breathe in. I found myself checking whether it was still working and you're never 100% sure if you got any and how much you got.  I prefer the GSK rotahaler but they discontinued it.,1.0,,"For Asthma, acute:","Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",1.0

698,2020-03-22,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,I don't know whose idea this was. It dispenses the medicine in a powder instead of finer air size particles This obviously doesn't work very well because air can be breathed into your lungs whereas a powder gets stuck somewhere along the way from your mouth to your lungs. I can literally feel the powder getting stuck in my throat instead of going where it's supposed to. My expired pro air puff inhaler works better than this and I know because I've had to dig around to find it when I'm having an asthma attack since the respiclick does nothing.,1.0,Taken for 6 months to 1 year,"For Asthma, acute:","Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",1.0

784,2020-02-19,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,This is a new drug for me. I was surprised I had to inhale the medication. Thank goodness I don’t have asthma. I would be frightened to death trying to inhale this medication during an attack. I’m being treated for complications after pneumonia. I did feel/ taste the powder on the back of my tongue so I think it worked. Can’t say l feel differently having taken it about 30 min ago.

With the old inhaler, I could feel, even taste the medicine. I could feel my lungs relax. This one... I feel nothing. my lungs feel just as tight as before. This is a piece of garbage and the Teva company should be ashamed of this product, 300 patents wasted. 3M tried this type of inhalator 20 years ago and that was proven to not deliver medicine either.

801,2020-02-15,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,This is a dangerous product! I had always used Albuterol spray for intermittent asthma. On a Sunday I had an asthma attack and was unable to find my inhaler and went to Urgent Care. They gave me a breathing treatment and a prescription for this ProAir Respiclick. That night I had another attack and was considering going to ER but first scrambled around house and thankfully found old inhaler with a few puffs left! The next day I went to my primary doctor who said she had heard so many terrible things about this product she wouldn't prescribe it! She gave me an RX for the regular spray Albuterol. I think everyone needs to report this to the FDA!

For a device you rely on to save your life, you just need to believe that maybe it worked, maybe it didn’t?   And when you’re already short of breath, sucking hard to get the medicine out is not really an option.

My expired ProAir (with spacer) works 100X better as a rescue medicine than the do-nothing ProAir Respliclick. I found absolutely no relief from the $60 Respliclick. (My insured cost).

1354,2019-09-02,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,This was prescribed to be by the ER doctor for “as needed” and I hate it. It is the worst thing when you can’t breathe in. Why? Because if you can’t breathe how do you breathe in enough to get the medicine?! I’ve had to try 3 or four times to get one dose. The medicine itself seems to be good but why in the world would someone who has problems breathing to the point of going to the ER be given something that is so difficult to get to?!,1.0,Taken for less than 1 month,"For Asthma, acute:","Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",

1601,2019-06-10,ProAir RespiClick,albuterol,ProAir Respiclick had zero effectiveness for me. You would have to be a long distance runner to be able to inhale this powder into your lungs. What a waste. This was just another way for the company to get a patent for albuterol so they could make money. If I could give a minus rating I would. I got this drug due to a mixup with my insurance where they said they wouldn't cover the HFA.

I have also used the ProAir RespiClick device for my reactive airway symptoms to determine why my patients are complaining that they aren't experiencing any symptom relief with it.  I have no idea how the ProAir RespiClick even made it through trials to be approved for patient use.  This device is only activated if the patient is able to inhale forcefully and deeply enough to cause the powder to be released and inhaled. In the event of an asthmatic episode, the patient is already struggling to breathe deeply/forcefully, hence their urgent need for relief.  If someone can't breathe, it makes no sense that their lifesaving medication won't work unless their lung function isn't compromised.
