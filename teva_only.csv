My period was almost a week late. eventually it started (my period) and now I'm still bleeding almost two weeks later with dryish blood clots, I'm scared this will trigger that thing that tampons do because they are dry and could get stuck, maybe I'm paranoid.

Peel the label up on the backside. Twist the bottom section in your left hand - away from you. Throw the top section away!  Remove the white mouth cover.  Put the canister - dispenser side down, into lower section, lining up the nozzle. When secured, place both thumbs at bottom sides, below mouth piece. Put both pointer fingers at top sides of canister.  Get ready to use like a traditional inhaler - press down on canister and breathe in medication. Feel free to confirm your inhaler works by testing it - with mouthpiece directed away from your face. The two RedihHalers I tested this on - both actually gave out visible doses - something neither had done in a while. 

If you want to be extra safe - use the white mouthpiece cover when inhaler is not in use. But definitely throw out the heavy plastic piece with the Qvar label. Worthless junk for our landfills!",2.0,Taken for 10 years or more,"For Asthma, Maintenance:","Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",1 / 10

I had cramping and low back pain for about 48 hours after but now I’m feeling great! I am experiencing some light spotting.

I switched because I was struggling with hormonal birth control. I tried the Nexplanon and 2 pills. I was constantly bleeding on the Nexplanon.

I was initially taking depo which caused me to bleed everyday straight for 3 months (the same amount I normally would at the start of a period, except EVERYDAY) and suffered from cramps from time to time and nausea.

I went back to the hospital and was told that Ibuprofen helps with bleeding. Now with Ibuprofen my periods are down to normal 4-6 day periods. It seems like every month my periods are getting shorter and less painful. One thing I really don't like is the cramp that I feel 3-4 days before my period starts. Out of nowhere I will have 3-4 hour long terrible cramps but no bleeding. I basically live addicted to Ibuprofen and I am always ready to take one as soon as a cramp starts. Despite of all the cons I am actually happy with it because my relationship with my boyfriend totally improved since we stopped freaking out about the possibility of me being pregnant. Also stay away from vibrators because it can cause cramping.,6.0,,For Birth Control:,"Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",7 / 10

I had immediate relief with the first 5 months only having less than 5 migraines. I didn't even refill my break through Rizatripten. Then on the 6 month they came back but not to the serious degree they once were. I did have to start using my break through pain medication. But then about 8 months later my migraines have seemed to stop again. I do like the new instant injection feature they just added to it. 
I am a male in my 50's and I feel I have had absolutely no side affects what so ever on this medication.  None!! Only problem I have is my insurance company keeps mucking me around telling to try the other injectable Aimovig?

I was about to give up but reading all the reviews convinced me to stick with it and hope that the purge period will not be too long or to painful (I have break outs now on my chin and around my mouth).

I also noticed I had acne again which my face was spotless prior to the pill. The second month was the worst. I had bad nausea, had to pull over while driving to puke later at night (fixed by taking the pill at a later time). I was constantly miserable and sick every day. My sex drive was gone and I got a yeast infection the week before sugar pills. I didn't get my period and got brown spotting. The third month wasn't bad, no nausea but acne got worse. Over the three months I gained 15 lbs.

The weight gain is causing more issues physically such as my fibro flares. Probably going to go back to Emgality. 40lbs weight gain in a year is ridiculous.

Since then, ten years later, I have not had any weight gain, headaches or nausea and I can’t say that it has effects my mood either.

The first two months my bleeding was very irregular but it stabilized after 3 months. In regards to helping with menstration it’s great! However it did virtually nothing for my skin and actually made my skin break out more frequently on my chin and around my mouth area.  I recently switched my birth control to Nikki, which is a generic form of Yaz. If you struggle with hormonal acne like me, I would not take Junel for that. Take a birth control pill that contains a progestin that’s anti-androgenic (Like Nikki, Yaz, Beyaz, ortho-tri-cyclen). 
In regards to mood on this pill (Junel) I didn’t really notice a difference. I did notice that I lost weight on this pill, perhaps it’s just a coincidence.

A few months later I felt an irritation inside my nose with random nose bleeds. Drs said It wasn't from the Qnasl otherwise it would have happened sooner. 

My ENT diagnosed a nasal ulceration but not from the Qnasl. After months of tests they were all baffled and 11 months in the ulceration became a perforation! Discussing with my ENT  I asked again if it could be the Qnasl (which had been initially ruled out because the clinical trials only had 1 nasal ulceration and no perforations.)

I asked him to review everything because I'm the patient that gets those super rare side effects, and he finally agreed that it must be the Qnasl and I must stop taking it.

The worst part has to be the constant emotional mood swings and change in sex drive. I do not cry normally but on this pill, I have full days where I cannot stop crying for no reason. My sex drive lowered significantly and it dries me out during sex even when I am in the mood which was never an issue before. I am easily irritable, overly sensitive and depressed when I’m on my period. I’ve tried to stick it out in hopes of it getting better but the side effects have actually enhanced overtime.

When your body starts rejecting what’s in it, you start to feel so much pain physically/mentally and you don’t know where it’s coming from. I wasted the last 3 years not understanding what was happening to my body..... but now I do.",6.0,,For Birth Control:,"Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",

I was starting to question myself, my body, my mind, my relationship, felt like I just could NOT get better. I'm disappointed it took me so long to realize this was the only change.

Then it stopped for a day and then came back again for 2 more weeks. Heavy and dark red. Went to the doctor and he confirmed I was pregnant 4 to 6 weeks but likely going through a miscarriage. That means I was pregnant BEFORE taking the pill. Not to blame the entire miscarriage on the pill but I have an odd suspicion taking it didn't help. I had no idea I was pregnant. If I knew I would have NEVER taken Plan B ever. So currently I'm still undergoing testing to make sure the miscarriage goes as its suppose to :( If not then they'll have to preform a D and C which I'm not looking forward to.

After the visual exam she said it seemed fine, but an ultrasound revealed that my IUD had dropped too low into my cervix AND was partially twisted, with one arm not fully deployed. They suspect when I got it inserted I wasn't properly measured, and my too-small uterus had been trying to expel it over time.

The technician said that if it couldn't be easily removed in the office ASAP, they'd need to do it in a hospital. Thankfully, it came out with no issues.

However, I had a lot of scarring from the purge period that still made it look like my skin was bad. I started wearing sunscreen every day my skin actually started to flourish. It’s been about a month since my skin has been completely clear and my scarring has faded almost completely. What I used to consider oil now is more of a dewy finish that makes my skin look great.

Trying to lose weight right now and  despite eating at what I calculate to be a slight caloric deficit, been steadily gaining weight, ~.3 pounds a day. So distressing to see the number on the scale go up every single day despite doing everything ""right"". Already gained 5 pounds in the past 2-ish months due to binge eating but suspect that a chunk of that weight gain was from the birth control. Praying to GOD that it's only water retention.

Also weight gain isn't in ""right places"" (though don't realy want to gain weight in butt or chest either) IT'S LITERALLY ALL IN MY STOMACH AND THIGHS??? Why?

I went to the gynecologist and the dermatologist in the same day and they both did not agree with the reason with me having the acne was caused from Tri-Sprintec and both agreed I should be on it again. That it will help my acne now I haven’t used the pills I did pick it up from the pharmacy however but haven’t used them yet because I am waiting until after my period.

I have had the Paragard for 6 months now, my periods are back to normal after the first 4 months and I never feel it inside. I had light periods before insertion & they are still light after.

I felt possessed and I had no control over my emotions. I'm usually a chill person and this pill made me angry and upset at things which I wouldn't typically bat an eyelid at.  The first month was actually ok and I thought it would stay that way. It got much worse after a month. Was lead to believe symptoms would improve after 3 months but they only continued to get more and more severe. Worst 4 months of my life taking this pill.

I had no choice really. I had a severely painful ovarian cyst pop after sex (not my first time) and I decided it was enough of going to the hospital and suffering. I started this pill a week ago and I’ll update as much as I can .. so far I had some foggy days in the beginning and felt pretty weird but then it went away and the nausea has been on and off (which they say is normal) I do drink a lot of herbal tea already so that has probably been helping it (peppermint/etc) and now my only complaints are this random brown discharge today(first time kinda) and itchy/burning bumps/pimples that keep popping up everywhere the past few days.

My cycle is not regular (30-33 days) so I plugged my last period and my cycles into several ovulation calculators and was really scared to learn on the date of the accident. I was one, two, or three days from ovulation.

I only had a few side effects of Plan B, some awful lower abdominal cramping that lasted three days and some mild nausea that lasted one. I also spotted pink before my period started (which I thought was implantation bleeding, and I freaked). I got my period today, a 31 day cycle. I have never been happier to be visited by Aunt Flo.

I took the pill about an hour after that happened. A week later I started spotting but it was somewhat heavy spotting. The following weeks I experienced headaches, cramps on and off, increased appetite, sore breasts, increased discharge, and I became very emotional. In addition, my period was due on the 25th of Nov. I was convinced I was pregnant. This past week I’ve had an increase in the intensity of cramps and luckily my period came today (Dec 1), which is exactly a week from my expected period arrival date.

My IUD insertion was about 10 minutes. The process of getting inserted was uncomfortable but still manageable. The first three months was awful because my period would be two weeks long and spot on and off for the rest of the month. On top of that I was constantly getting cramps and lower backaches. After six months my cramping did get better and the period shortened up, but it was still heavy as anything. I'm about 11 months in with this IUD and I'm considering getting it removed. Even though it claims to be non-hormonal it definitely messed up my hormones a lot. I'm constantly getting acne when my skin has been clear most of my life, and I feel bloated all the time.

HOWEVER, the reason I’m going off of it is because I feel like it changed me completely as a person. I feel like I have no emotions, which is terrible because of my patient loving boyfriend. I feel like this birth control protected me from emotions because I feel so disconnected with the world & myself.

This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.

To make a future point, I also had zero acne and no family history of acne. About a month in, my acne got so bad I never considered the cause was Cryselle (Norgestrel 0.3mg, ethinyl estradiol 0.30mg) . My periods were so light and only lasted 2 days. Never had any cramps and I felt like I could live my life. But my acne was all over my body and it hurt to even put glasses on. After a year on antibiotics for the acne (which helped a lot), the acne came back when my only medication was this birth control. Finally, after 1.5 years, I switched to Sprintec (Norgestimate 0.25mg, ethinyl estradiol 0.035mg)instead is has a different type of progestin and slightly more estradiol. Now, my acne is completely gone. When I read reviews saying the medication has no effect on acne, don’t always trust them. Was even told this by my doctor.

After a couple months of taking this pill, I experienced physical/mental health issues including depression, heart palpitations/shortness of breath that sometimes felt like I was about to have a anxiety attack, irritability and mood swings that made me angry and later regretful, breast soreness, feeling unmotivated and extremely tired, as well as feeling weak overall, and a noticeable decrease in libido as I got into the 3rd/ 4th month of this birth control. Birth control effects everyone different, but with so many similar reviews on here I thought I would share my input and strongly guide everyone who reads this to look into another alternative for birth control.

Overall, I am satisfied with Nora Be and haven’t had any pregnancies while taking it.

Those have all resolved.  It has to be taken at the same time every day, so I set an alarm and am pretty good about taking it on time. I take a pregnancy test now and then if my period runs late.

No hair loss/oiliness, normal sex drive, no yeast infections (my doctor rec. taking a probiotic), no migraines, no breakthrough bleeding. No signs of any of the more serious side effects like blood clots etc. 

Cons: On the first few days of the placebo week, I experience some depression and anxiety. I do have a history of these issues though, so that may be a factor.  Some moodiness. I don't get as ""wet"" during sex. Some fatigue in the first month. 

In weighing the pros and cons, I'm moderately satisfied taking the pill.",6.0,Taken for 1 to 6 months,For Birth Control:,"Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.",7 / 10

I've been on Loryna and Lo-Esterin Fe previously and I did not do well on those - bloating, weight gain, mood swings etc.  
I was hesitant to try Tri-lo Sprintec, but will say its been great! I'm using it primarily to keep regular menstrual cycles and eliminate horrible cramps I was having all throughout the month. The cramps are basically gone (one day of cramping on my period now), my skin has become more consistently clear (which has been a major issue since I was 10 years old),  & my periods are regular. I have not experienced mood swings, bloating, or other unwanted side effects. Very mild nausea a few times is the only one I've noticed, and I believe the longer that I take the pill, it will diminish even further.

Overall I didn’t mind Heather but I did get nausea on it and my periods weren’t predictable. I asked to switch back to my tried and true- ortho tri cyclen lo, only to find out they don’t make it anymore! Insert huge sad face with streaming tears. Still hopeful, I tried the generic version- this one Tri-Lo-Sprintec. It is definitely no way like it at all.

I would not go past 8am if you are sensitive to medications. Otherwise you will be up all night long ready to run around. 
You also need to change the foods you eat. We are fat because of what we eat. This is not a magic pill that will melt your fat away. You need to correct yourself for it to really help you on your weight loss journey. This is all common sense. It raises your heart rate up (it's almost like speed).

Only apply the gel at night since exposure to the sun is to be avoided when you have it on.

Absolutely! Medications, i.e. insulin, all have side effects. As a patient, you must ask yourself if the side effects outweigh the benefits. 
I refused treatment until age 32 which has been beneficial to my physical health.

If you are at the mercy of ADHD, I strongly advise you to use some of the new apps with or without meds. Daily for the 1st 3 weeks is simply miraculous.

2673,2017-06-06,Plan B One-Step,levonorgestrel,"Okay ladies, I have decided to share my experience with Plan B One Step to hopefully help ease even just a few minds, because I know just how bad this situation sucks and how you are searching high and low for some honest feedback. No matter what I say here, you will still be freaking out for a while and overthinking every little thing you feel within your body. Just try your best to be positive and keep busy. 

Alright, so here goes the story: On Apr. 9 I had sex with a male partner and the condom broke. We didn't notice until the deed was done. Immediately I thought ""omg we are screwed"". I had finished my last period on Apr. 4 (I was now dangerously close to ovulation). The next morning (approx 6-7 hrs later) we went to the pharmacy to get emergency contraception. I took the pill immediately WITH FOOD. The food part is very important. The pill can make you nauseous and if you vomit soon after taking it, it obviously will not work. The pill contains very high levels of Levonorgestrel, a synthetic version of the hormone Progestin (aka the pregnancy hormone). When you become pregnant, your body produces high levels of Progestin, which prevents your ovaries from releasing an egg (because you wouldn't want your body to be ovulating while you are already pregnant). So, in a sense, the pill tricks your body into thinking it is pregnant and therefore your ovaries do not release an egg for the sperm that is now inside of you to fertilize. 

The effectiveness of this all comes down to timing. The pill's job is to temporarily stop ovulation, so if you have already ovulated, the chances of it working are lowered. This doesn't mean you are totally screwed! There isn't much conclusive evidence (that I have been able to find) but it is said that even shortly after ovulation, the pill can help prevent a newly fertilized egg from implanting in the uterine wall. It is important to follow the advice to take the pill within 72hrs of the incident because sperm can live inside of you for approx 5 days and the longer you let it go, the closer you get to ovulating and the better chance those little suckers have of locating your egg! 

Back to the fact that the pill temporarily stops ovulation. This means that Plan B is NOT an abortion pill! So whether you are worried to take it because you are pro-life or you are thinking it will terminate an established pregnancy, it WILL NOT DO THIS! The pill's job is to take action before the sperm and egg ever meet.

Now onto the stuff that will literally exhaust you... The side effects. I'm going to be honest here and tell you that looking up your side effects is going to make you think you are pregnant for sure. Almost every possible side effect of Plan B mimics the signs of pregnancy. You could experience: nausea, abdominal cramping, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, vomiting, and spotting. If you are concerned about any of these side effects contact your doctor. They will be your best source of support through this. I experienced mild abdominal cramping (like period cramps) the next couple of days after taking the pill and ""spotting"" about a week later. The spotting was what concerned me. When I read that you ""may experience some spotting"" I thought a light little speck here and there, however for me it was almost exactly like one of my periods. My periods are generally quite light (lucky, I know) and my ""spotting"" was almost the exact same, just slightly lighter and lasted about 3-4 days. It started out fairly bright red and then by the last day turned to a darker red, almost brownish colour. I later found out that this is quite normal.

Throughout the duration of my worrisome experience, I took 3 home pregnancy tests to help ease my mind a bit. I took one 21 days after the incident, another 6 days later, and then one like 4 weeks after that (just because I was feeling particularly worried that day). All 3 read negative. This helped settle my mind somewhat.

Also, a little info that may be a bit TMI, but about 2 weeks after taking the pill I got a yeast infection (see, TMI). On top of worrying about everything else, I now had a painful and embarrassing infection to add to my list! I was freaking out because I wasn't sure what it was at first (painful urination, labia painful to the touch). Upon +++ research on my own, I found out that this is another possible side effect of the pill. The increased hormones in the pill can cause your body to produce an excessive amount of natural yeast. The same thing can happen to women during pregnancy due to the same reason. So if this happens to you, it's uncommon but not unheard of. 

The biggest worry I had throughout this entire experience was when in the world was I going to get my period?! The pill can and probably will mess with your cycle. It definitely did for me! I'm not sure if it had anything to do with my size, but I'm thinking that it might have. I am fairly petite (115lbs) and the pill is the same dosage for everyone. I ended up missing an entire period! Talk about going out of mind! Everywhere I read said that the pill could delay your period by a week or so, but nowhere could I find anything about it making you skip an entire period! Just as I was mustering up the plan to make a doctor's appointment, my period arrived! Exactly one month late. Again, I can't stress enough to talk to your doctor if something doesn't seem right!

I really hope you found some kind of relief in reading this. There is no sure shot way to know Plan B has worked unless you get a blood test from your doctor or are graced with your Aunt Flo so do your absolute best not to worry yourself sick. Remember, stress can have an effect on your cycle as well. I found it most helpful to confide what I was going through in one really good, trustworthy friend who helped bring me back to reality when my worry was spinning me out of control. I hope everything works out for you, and you share your experiences with others going through the same, terrifying experience.

-Constant chin acne 
-Bad PMS that would start a week after getting my period so I felt like I never had a break. That food craving/sore breasts/ emotional/angry feeling would pop up 2 weeks before my period even started. Basically it was 1 week of normal and the rest was all hormonal.

 I switched pills b/c of headaches, VERY tender breasts, and the pill causing zero libido (I'm not exaggerating).

 Cryselle improved my headaches, although I still have them they are not as bad.  Breasts are also not as sore, although Cryselle caused them to grow huge. Libido is better, but only by like 10% (which is generous).

I recommend gel, it leaves a nice, smooth finish.

I wash my face at night with the soap, mostly dry my face (leaving face damp), then apply the ziana, and the apply the lotion. This way, the products absorb better, and also felt good.

I went back to Ritalin which is the cheapest of them all cause I thought I was better. Never been more wrong! Not being on the provigil has shown me, I DO HAVE NARCOLEPSY.

This is because it's a low estrogen pill. With Junel Fe I began to get acne all over my face - my jaw, cheeks, forehead, and chin. I would get up to 7 painful, embarrassing cystic lumps at a time and tons of zits that were oddly prone to leaving scars. I went from almost perfect skin to having adult acne!

I've had a ParaGard for about a month now, and opted for ParaGard over birth control pills or a hormonal IUD because I liked the idea of a hormone free option. Previously I'd been on birth control pills for several years, and although my experience with the pill was generally positive it took my body awhile to regulate after I discontinued use the first time. 

After doing some research I decided to have the ParaGard inserted at Planned Parenthood as opposed to my regular OBGYN because the providers there insert dozens of these a day and have more experience with them. I've never had a baby and the insertion was uncomfortable but bearable. It basically felt like a very intense cramp, but was over in a few minutes. I'm sure that it helps to have an experienced provider Following the insertion I felt like I had mild to moderate menstrual cramps, but was able to return to work for the rest of the afternoon with minimal discomfort. 

In the week following the insertion you will need to wear panty liners because you leak a clearish brownish fluid which feels a bit strange. The feeling freaked me out at first but it went away pretty quickly and stopped altogether within a week. In the weeks that followed I had intermittent menstrual cramps as my body adjusted. My biggest fear was that my cramps during my period would be unbearable (they are usually very bad), but I was happy to find out that they weren't any worse than usual although my period was heavier.

Around two days later I experienced a yeast infection, which was mild, and cleaned up on its own a few days later, but I was freaking out.  After research, I learned that Plan B can restart your cycle, causing the pH balance to be thrown off in the process, causing the yeast infection. I experienced a lot of mood swings over the few weeks, however my boyfriend was always extremely supportive and reminded me it would be alright and we had nothing to worry about.  If it wasn’t for him, I would have drove myself bananas for those few weeks.  I definitely recommend having your partner being a strong support system; it will make the process so much better when you know you’re not alone in this.

The fact of the matter is, when testing plan b, the group of tested women were all around the same weight, and there was no group of women that was tested that weighed over 175.

5168,2008-04-02,Adderall,amphetamine/dextroamphetamine,"Against the advice of my teachers, my mom decided not to medicate me as a kid since my grades were fine. As I got older, I got worse, concentrating was impossible for me and my grades dropped... my mind never stopped! I have been on Adderall for almost 9 years now. This drug saved me, it worked great! The down side...after this long, I have built a tolerance, get very irritable, and feel kinda foggy or dazed by the end of the day.

5177,2008-02-28,Actiq,fentanyl,"I have horrible nerve pain. Neither vicodin, oxycontin, morphine or any other opium based medicine worked. Plus my body had gotten used to the other pain pills. The actiq was AMAZING! It almost completely rid me of the pain (1000x stronger than morphine) and it is measured in micrograms (Mcg)it is so powerful.
